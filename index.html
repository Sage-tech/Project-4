  <p>This is a typical paragraph for the UI Kit. <a href="#" class="link">Here is what a link might look like</a>.
    The
    typical font family for this kit is Lato. This kit is intended for clean and refreshing web layouts.
    No jazz hands here, just the essentials to make dreams come true, with minimal clean web design. The kit comes
    fully equipped with everything from full responsive media styling to buttons to form fields. <em>I enjoy using
      italics as well from time to time</em>.
    Feel free to create the most amazing designs ever with this kit. I truly hope you enjoy not only the kit but
    this
    amazing paragraph as well. :)</p>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">You know what really gets me going? A really nice set of block quotes. That's
    right, block quotes that say, "Hey,
    I'm an article you want to read and nurture."</blockquote>
